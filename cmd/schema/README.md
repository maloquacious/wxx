# schema
`schema` is a command-line tool for analyzing Worldographer data files (WXX files) and generating Go structs that match their XML schema.

## Overview

Worldographer stores map data as GZip-compressed, UTF-16 encoded XML files. This tool:

1. **Reads WXX files** - Decompresses and converts UTF-16 to UTF-8
2. **Infers XML schema** - Analyzes the XML structure to understand elements and attributes  
3. **Generates Go structs** - Creates typed structs that can marshal/unmarshal the XML data

## Current Status

The tool currently:
- âœ… Reads and decompresses WXX files
- âœ… Detects XML schema version (1.0 vs 1.1)
- âœ… Infers element hierarchy and attributes
- âœ… Outputs XML hierarchy for analysis

**In Development:**
- ðŸ”„ Generate Go structs with proper naming conventions
- ðŸ”„ Add XML tags for marshaling/unmarshaling
- ðŸ”„ Handle nested structs and collections

## Usage

```bash
go run cmd/schema/main.go
```

Currently reads from `input/blank-2025-1.10-1.01.wxx` and outputs:
- `output/blank-2025-1.10-1.01.xml` - Converted XML file
- Console output showing XML hierarchy

## XML Schema Versions

The tool supports two Worldographer versions:

**Worldographer Classic (XML 1.0)**
- No schema version attribute
- Uses release "2017", version "1.74", schema "1.0"

**Worldographer 2025 (XML 1.1)**  
- Includes schema version in map element
- Uses release "2025", version "1.10", schema "1.01"

## Generated Code Conventions

- **Structs**: Use `_t` suffix (e.g., `Map_t`, `Configuration_t`)
- **Interfaces**: Use `_i` suffix when needed
- **No anonymous structs**: All child elements are typed as named structs
- **XML tags**: Include proper `xml:"elementName"` tags

## Future Features

- Command-line flags for input/output files
- Type inference for attributes (string, int, bool)
- Support for repeated elements as slices
- SQLite schema generation
- Validation of generated structs against original XML
